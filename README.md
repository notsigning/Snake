# Snake
Snake game in Java using javax.swing and java.awt.
Please do not run Snake.java, and run SnakeMain.java, because one is clearly labeled and designed to have a main method.

This code is mostly for learning purposes and as reference, but may also be used for entertainment purposes.

To play the game, make sure you have a Java compiler installed, and run SnakeMain. Note that both files are required to play.
